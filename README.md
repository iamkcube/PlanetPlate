# Resatiate

Welcome to **Resatiate**! We are a food distribution platform that connects restaurants with local NGOs in need of surplus food, while also recycling by-products for use in industries.

# About Us

In many cities throughout our country, there is a lack of proper planning to manage food resources. This often leads to a large amount of food waste from restaurants and other
sources.

To address this issue, we propose creating a food channel that redistributes surplus food from restaurants to organizations in need, such as NGOs, to feed hungry and needy people.

In addition, we plan to establish a recycling channel for oil and other by-products used in food preparation. These materials can be distributed to oil refineries and other industries for
reuse.

For our project, we aimed to implement a solution that targets three Sustainable
Development Goals, including:

1. Zero Hunger
2. Sustainable Cities
3. Responsible Consumption & Production
